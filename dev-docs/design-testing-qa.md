# Testing & QA Plan (win-symlinks)

This document outlines the testing strategy, acceptance criteria, and manual verification scenarios for the `win-symlinks` project.

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

- Parse `ln -s TARGET LINK_NAME`.
- Parse `ln -sf TARGET LINK_NAME`.
- Parse `ln -sT TARGET LINK_NAME`.
- Reject unsupported hardlink-style `ln TARGET LINK_NAME`.
- Normalize paths before blacklist matching.
- Match blacklisted prefixes by path component.
- Do not match sibling prefixes such as `C:\WindowsTools` for `C:\Windows`.
- Reject malformed native paths and suspicious UNC administrative shares.
- Reject ADS-style `link_path` inputs.
- Canonicalize or reject `\\?\` long-path inputs before blacklist matching.
- Require target kind when target is missing and cannot be inferred.
- Detect `TARGET_KIND_CONFLICT` when the broker's final target-kind decision conflicts with the CLI hint.

### Integration Tests

- Create a true file symlink through the broker.
- Create a true directory symlink through the broker.
- Confirm created objects are symbolic links, not junctions or hardlinks.
- Confirm `ln -sf` replaces an existing symbolic link.
- Confirm `ln -sf` refuses to replace a real file.
- Confirm `ln -sf` refuses to replace a real directory.
- Confirm deletion removes only the symbolic link and leaves the target intact.
- Confirm source blacklist blocks protected paths.
- Confirm source blacklist blocks ADS and long-path bypass attempts.
- Confirm the broker rejects remote Named Pipe clients.
- Confirm the Named Pipe DACL does not allow anonymous, `Everyone`, or network logon access.
- Confirm the client rejects a pipe server that does not match the installed `WinSymlinksBroker` service.
- Confirm a caller cannot create a symlink in a parent directory where that caller lacks create/write permission.
- Confirm concurrent requests for the same `link_path` are serialized and the second request observes the final state.
- Confirm service unavailable errors are clear when broker is not installed.
- Confirm `doctor` reports the resolved `ln.exe` path.

### Manual Acceptance Scenarios

First run from an administrator shell on Windows 11:

```text
win-symlinks.exe service install
win-symlinks.exe service status
```

Then run from a non-admin shell with Developer Mode disabled:

```text
ln -s target.txt link.txt
ln -s target-dir link-dir
ln -s --win-kind=file future-target.txt future-link.txt
ln -sf target2.txt link.txt
win-symlinks.exe doctor
```

Finally run from an administrator shell:

```text
win-symlinks.exe service uninstall
```

Expected result:

- Service installation requires administrator approval.
- Once installed, non-admin `ln -s` can create real symbolic links.
- The implementation never creates junctions, hardlinks, copies, or `.lnk` files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The design document exists at `docs/windows-symlink-broker-design.md`. (Note: originally as a single document, now split into multiple focused documents).
- The project is consistently named `win-symlinks`.
- `ln.exe` is the Linux-compatible command name.
- `win-symlinks.exe` is the management command name.
- `WinSymlinksBroker` is the Windows Service name.
- The document clearly states that command names and service names do not need to match.
- The document clearly states that service installation can be done without an installer package but still requires administrator rights.
- The document clearly states that source uses a blacklist policy.
- The document clearly states that only real symbolic links are supported.
- The document defines the service account as `LocalSystem`.
- The document requires local-only Named Pipe IPC and explicit pipe DACL.
- The document requires caller identity validation and caller parent-directory write authorization.
- The document documents blacklist limitations, ADS handling, long-path handling, and TOCTOU limits.
- The document includes Rust crate recommendations.
- The document includes test cases for true symlink creation and refusal of fallback object types.
